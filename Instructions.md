TRIALREACH HTML AND CSS ASSESSMENT
  
***********************************************

Any questions please email tom@trialreach.com

################################################# 

In this directory, you’ll find a Photoshop visual. Taking this, we’d like you to replicate it in HTML and CSS. 

Do as much as you can in 4 hours, making notes of those things that you weren't able to complete on time with some indication of how you would do it.

We've cut out some of the images for you but there may be more. It is up to you to decide which are part of the content and which are purely for styling purposes.

We don’t want to see any JavaScript in this instance, so don’t worry about that side of the build. We’ve outlined the criteria we’ll be looking for below, this should give you a good idea of what we’re expecting from you.

Include in the README.md any assumptions you've made, any key design choices you made in solving the problem; and what you might have done to improve the program for real-world use given more time.

When you have completed the assessment, package all source code into one folder named with your surname and first initial of your first name in letter case with no spaces (e.g. SmithJ or SkywalkerL). Create a zip archive of this folder (e.g. SmithJ.zip or SkywalkerL.zip) and submit this file as an email attachment within 24 hours of receiving this test.



-----------
HTML
-----------

We’re looking for markup that validates as HTML5 but don't forget that we're looking for cross-browser compatibility without JavaScript. Tidy, consistent and accessible HTML is very important.



-----------
CSS
-----------

Your CSS should be as lean as possible for the task in hand but also reusable & maintable. Imagine that this was the first page you were building of a large site that you may not be maintaining so think OO-CSS. 

Do not use a pre-processer, framework or boilerplate for the purposes of this test; we’re testing your own CSS skills.

Also don't minify your stylesheet. We'll want to see it clearly.

We highly encourage the use of progressive enhancement over pixel-perfection, embracing many of the decorative aspects of CSS3 as long as legacy browsers get an acceptable experience. We ask that you don’t use any JavaScript to aid styling.



-----------
JS
-----------

NO JAVASCRIPT. We do use on our site but want to see how you cope without it.



---------------------
Browser Compatibility
---------------------

The browsers we require you to support are Internet Explorer 8–10 as well as modern Firefox, Chrome and Safari. 

Always strive to make all content accessible to legacy browsers – users should be able to view all content even if not beautifully styled.



---------------------
Any other questions?
---------------------

There's likely to be mnay things which aren't clear. Take your best guess and state any assumputions in your README.md
