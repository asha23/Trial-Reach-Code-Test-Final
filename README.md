Include in the README.md any assumptions you've made, any key design choices you made in solving the problem; and what you might have done to improve the program for real-world use given more time

################################################# 

The project took 2 hours to create with a further 1.5 hours for browser testing.

I have assumed that due to there not being any javascript in this project that HTML5 markup would not render correctly in unsupported browsers. This would require perhaps the modernizr library.

I have, however added a small piece of javascript to the form on the Search, to clear the search field when clicked on. This saves the user having to select and delete the form information. It's inline, and common practice.

I have attempted to make the code as simple as possible, and all the style information as descriptive as possible.

################################################# 

What I would have done.

Created all the code using semantic HTML5 markup. 

Utilised a CSS framework such as LESS or SASS, to modularise the CSS code. In this instance, instead of this, I have used global styles such as fs12 (font size 12) to easily set font sizing across the design. I have done the same with common colours.. IE (grey/orange) - This means that you can set colours quickly without writing individual styles, thus cutting down the amount of styles needed.

To improve on the design, I would have definitely thought about designing for mobile-first, then using media queries to make the site responsive. This is becoming more and more common-practice.

In the news items, there should perhaps be Read More buttons underneath each one so that users can drill into further information
